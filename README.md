## Introduction

The Endless Focus Scalper FX is a trading robot designed to open, manage, and close positions in the GBPUSD currency pair. It utilizes various trade functions to execute a trading strategy and dynamically manage trade ratios.

## Trade Functions

This code provides several trade functions that can be used to execute the trading strategy:

1. `OpenPosition(double lotSize, double stopLoss, double takeProfit)`: This function opens a position in the GBPUSD pair using the specified lot size, stop loss, and take profit levels.

2. `ClosePosition()`: This function closes the currently open position in the GBPUSD pair.

3. `SetTakeProfitStopLoss(double takeProfit, double stopLoss)`: This function sets and adjusts the take profit and stop loss levels.

4. `ManageTradePositions()`: This function monitors and manages trade positions in real-time.

5. `HandleTradeErrors()`: This function handles trade execution errors and exceptions.

6. `CalculateTradeRatios()`: This function calculates and manages trade ratios dynamically.

## Trading Strategy

The main function `OnTick()` implements the trading strategy for the Endless Focus Scalper FX. This function is called on every tick of the market. The trade functions defined above are used to open, close, set take profit and stop loss levels, manage trade positions, handle trade errors, and calculate trade ratios.

## Initialization and Cleanup

The trading robot is initialized using the `OnInit()` function, where necessary variables and settings are initialized. The resources used by the trading robot are cleaned up and deinitialized using the `OnDeinit(const int reason)` function.

## Execution

The trading robot is started using the `OnStart()` function. It first calls the `OnInit()` function to initialize the robot, then runs the trading strategy on every tick of the market using a while loop. The loop continues until the robot is stopped. Finally, the `OnDeinit(0)` function is called to clean up and deinitialize the robot.
